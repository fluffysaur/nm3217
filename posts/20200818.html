          <p>"No Reflections" is a creative advertising campaign consisting of a series of prints published in June 2020 by Leo Burnett for Samsung to promote their OLED TVs with Ultra Black Elite Technology.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Description</h2>

          <p>The advertisement is set in a horror scene being displayed on a screen, with a masked serial killer in the foreground. However, the killer's lower half is amusingly covered by a reflection of a lamp, making it look as if he is wearing a bright yellow skirt.
            On the top left there is a SAMSUNG logo, and on the bottom right the caption "Don't let reflections ruin your movie" is accompanied by an image of a clear television screen without reflections - supposedly Samsung's OLED TV with Ultra Black Elite technology. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Analysis</h2>

          <p>The horror scene is created using muted, dark colours (or a lack thereof), alongside stereotypes of horror B-movies such as the serial killer wearing a mask, having a bladed weapon, tattered clothing; and the backdrop being an eerie forest with an abandoned shed in the background.
            However, this horrific portrayal and immersion is humorously ruined by the reflection of the lamp in bright warm colours, not only in stark contrast to the horror colour scheme but also causing the serial killer to seem less
            menacing by having the lamp reflection positioned to make it seem as if he is wearing a skirt.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Interpretation</h2>

          <p>The print clearly seeks to promote Samsung's line of OLED TVs with their new Ultra Black Elite technology that they claim is able to eliminate
            reflections of brightly lit objects on their television screens (especially for dark movies), allowing viewers to immerse themselves into movies as fully as possible without
            unwanted distractions caused by reflections that can adversely affect their experience.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Judgement</h2>

          <p>The message is clear, simple, and concise - with very few words needed to give viewers a reason to purchase Samsung's special OLED TVs.
            Furthermore, the comedic imagery used will very likely make the advertisement more memorable and prominent - because, a serial killer in a skirt is simply ridiculous!
            At this point I'm really fishing for downsides, but a limitation of the campaign would be that viewers may critique the ad's relevance and the necessity of such a TV - since
            no one in their right mind would place a lamp right in front of a television screen. However, I find this to be a very minor negative effect in contrast to the potential impact of
            the humorous depiction of the lamp skirt.
            Overall, this is a well-designed print campaign which is clearly and creatively communicated in a memorable way.
          </p>
